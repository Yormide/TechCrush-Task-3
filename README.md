#🍕 Pizza Place Sales Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place. The goal was to transform raw CSV data into actionable business insights using Python. By merging multiple datasets, I explored sales trends, identified peak operating hours, and evaluated menu performance to provide data-driven recommendations.

The Dataset
The analysis is based on four relational CSV files:

Orders: Date and time of every order placed.

Order Details: Specific pizzas and quantities included in each order.

Pizzas: Size and price information for each pizza variant.

Pizza Types: Descriptive data including names, categories, and ingredients.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: For data cleaning, merging, and manipulation.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and documentation.

Key Insights & Analysis
1. Financial Performance
Total Revenue: $817,860.05

Total Orders: 21,350

Average Order Value: ~$38.31

2. Peak Business Hours
The busiest times are during Lunch (12:00 PM – 1:00 PM) and Dinner (5:00 PM – 7:00 PM).

Friday stands out as the highest-grossing day of the week, while Sunday experiences the lowest volume.

3. Menu Performance
Top Sellers: The Classic Deluxe Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza lead in total quantity sold.

Underperformers: The Brie Carre Pizza had significantly lower sales than any other item on the menu.

4. Monthly Trends
Sales remained relatively stable throughout the year, with a slight peak in July and a minor dip in the autumn months (September/October).

Strategic Recommendations
Staffing: Increase kitchen staff during the 12 PM and 6 PM rushes, especially on Fridays.

Menu Optimization: Consider removing or rebranding the Brie Carre Pizza to reduce inventory waste.

Promotions: Introduce "Family Bundle" deals on Sundays to boost revenue during the slowest day of the week.
